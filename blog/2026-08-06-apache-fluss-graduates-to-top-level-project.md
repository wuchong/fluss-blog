## How We Got Here

![The Apache Fluss journey from launch to top-level project](assets/fluss_tlp/apache-fluss-journey-en.png)

Fluss was initiated by the Flink team at Alibaba Cloud in July 2023 to address long-standing challenges in streaming storage for analytical workloads, including unified streaming and batch storage, Flink state management, and complex data pipelines. Its goal was to build a unified streaming storage system for real-time analytics in the Lakehouse era. The name “Fluss” comes from **Flink Unified Streaming Storage** and also means “river” in German, reflecting the vision of data flowing continuously like a river before eventually joining the open Lakehouse.

After more than a year of development and large-scale production use within Alibaba, Fluss was officially [open-sourced at Flink Forward Asia 2024](https://fluss.apache.org/blog/fluss-open-source/) in Shanghai in November 2024. In June 2025, [Fluss entered the Apache Incubator](https://fluss.apache.org/blog/fluss-joins-asf/), evolving from a technology initiative originating at Alibaba into an open source project built by developers around the world.

During incubation, both the contributor community and interest in the project continued to grow. Today, the community includes **157 contributors**, and the project has earned **2,000+ stars on GitHub**, merged **1700+ pull requests**, bringing together developers from different countries and organizations in an active open source community.

At the same time, Fluss has been deployed in production at **Alibaba, Xiaohongshu (RedNote), Fresha, JD.com, Ant Group, iQIYI, and other companies**. It is used across log collection and analytics, real-time data warehousing, search and recommendation, indexing pipelines, and real-time feature serving. These deployments help organizations reduce cross-system data copies, lower real-time data processing and storage costs, and improve Lakehouse data freshness and analytical efficiency.

"When we started Fluss, I believed strongly in the problem we were solving, but the project has grown faster and reached further than I expected," said **Jark Wu, PMC Chair of Apache Fluss**. "The energy of the community and the growing number of companies running Fluss in production have been especially encouraging. Graduation is a new beginning, and I am confident Fluss will become a foundational real-time data layer for lakehouse architectures and AI applications that depend on fresh, continuously updated data."

## From Lakehouse to Lakestream: Unify Stream and Lakehouse for the Agentic Era

In the Agentic era, AI is evolving from chatbots that answer questions into agents capable of making autonomous decisions, using tools, and executing tasks. Data is no longer just an input to analytics; it is the real-time context agents rely on to reason and act. That context must span the full historical record while accurately reflecting the latest state of the business. Traditional Lakehouse architectures excel at storing and governing massive volumes of historical data, but struggle to continuously meet data-freshness requirements measured in seconds or even milliseconds.

As an open source pioneer of the Lakestream architecture, Apache Fluss adds a Lakehouse-native, real-time streaming storage layer on top of the data lake. It unifies continuously updated, real-time data with long-term history, giving AI agents fresh and complete context from the past through the present and enabling production-grade, real-time decisions and actions.

Apache Fluss brings the following core capabilities to the traditional Lakehouse, creating a unified Lakestream foundation that makes both historical and real-time data readily available:

- **Stream & Lakehouse Unification:** Long-term historical data resides in open data lake formats such as Apache Paimon, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Lance, while Fluss serves the latest data in real time. With Union Read, agents can access everything from historical data to the latest state through a unified table view, avoiding fragmented context.
- **Columnar Streaming Storage:** Built on the Apache Arrow columnar format, Fluss supports server-side column pruning, predicate pushdown, and partition pruning, reducing data reads and transfers for efficient streaming and real-time analytics.
- **Real-time Updates and Point Queries:** Primary-key tables natively support streaming updates, partial updates, changelogs, key-value lookups, and Delta Join, allowing the same real-time data to serve both stream processing and point queries.
- **Real-time Context for Agents:** Fluss unifies continuously updated real-time state with long-term historical data, giving AI agents fresh, complete, low-latency, and trustworthy context for real-time decisions and actions.
- **Open Ecosystem with Multi-Language Access:** Fluss works with compute engines such as Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and StarRocks and provides Java, Rust, Python, and C++ clients, making it easy for real-time analytics and AI applications to connect.

## Growing Community and Adoption
